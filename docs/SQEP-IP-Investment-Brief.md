## Executive Summary

SQEP-Zero is a **cryptographic AI platform** with multiple patentable innovations in deterministic reasoning, proof-of-intelligence, and verifiable AI systems. Unlike mainstream LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, LLaMA), our technology produces **provable, auditable, reproducible** results.

**Key differentiator:** Intelligence you can prove.

**Claims:**
- Method for offline AI reasoning
- System for edge-deployed deterministic intelligence
- Apparatus for resource-constrained AI execution

## Appendix: Quick Demo Commands

```bash
# 1. Teach a fact
./sqepctl ingest --fact "SQEP uses SHA-256 for hashing"

# 2. Verify deterministically
./sqepctl verify "SQEP uses SHA-256" --trace
# → Status: Verified | Confidence: 95% | Proof: proof-xxxxx

# 3. Same result via HTTP (transport invariance)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"intent":"verify","payload":{"statement":"SQEP uses SHA-256"}}'
# → Identical response, identical proof

# 4. Prove determinism (run 3x, get identical results)
./sqepctl query "Is SQEP secure?" --mode json
./sqepctl query "Is SQEP secure?" --mode json
./sqepctl query "Is SQEP secure?" --mode json
# → All three outputs are byte-identical
```
